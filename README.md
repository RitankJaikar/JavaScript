Learning JavaScript Again...

From Hitesh Chaudry- Chai aur code.

Why learning JS?
If you want to learn just coding, then don't. If you want to built great project/product then only proceed.

Prettier for Code formatting

MDN -> JS docs
https://tc39.es/ -> https://tc39.es/ecma262/ -> JS standards/ Guideline (little complex)

Master JS-> Objects, Brouser Events

DATATYPES:-
*These are primitive datatypes: (7)
number (includes NaN), bigint, string, boolean
null -> e.g. let a null;
undefined -> e.g. let a;
symbol -> unique (use in figma tools, symbols, unique components in react..)
*Non primitive datatypes (reference type): Object (array is an object in JS)

How you store and how you access is just difference between primitive and non-primitive

Primitive -> Stack memory (gives copy if we use anywhere)
Non-Primitive -> Heap memory (gives original address)

Method vs Function
Function declared normally or arrow function, as a variable or const
Methods are functions declared inside objects.
