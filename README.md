Learning JavaScript Again...

From Hitesh Chaudry- Chai aur code.

Why learning JS?
If you want to learn just coding, then don't. If you want to built great project/product then only proceed.

Prettier for Code formatting

MDN -> JS docs
https://tc39.es/ -> https://tc39.es/ecma262/ -> JS standards/ Guideline (little complex)

Master JS-> Objects, Browser Events

DATATYPES:-
*These are primitive datatypes: (7)
number (includes NaN), bigint, string, boolean
null -> e.g. let a null;
undefined -> e.g. let a;
symbol -> unique (use in figma tools, symbols, unique components in react..)
*Non primitive datatypes (reference type): Object (array is an object in JS)

How you store and how you access is just difference between primitive and non-primitive

Primitive -> Stack memory (gives copy if we use anywhere (deep copy)) (immutable )
Non-Primitive -> Heap memory (gives original address (shallow copy)) (mutable)

Method vs Function
Function declared normally or arrow function, as a variable or const
Methods are functions declared inside objects.

In JS to read or get input from user we can use:
-prompt()
    let input = prompt("Enter something:");
    console.log("You entered: " + input);
-HTML forms
-readline in Node.js
